Footnotes:
1,"Estimates for the quarter: Q1 = January to March; Q2 = April to June; Q3 = July to September; Q4 = October to December."
2,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of natural increase (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045)."
3,"The number of births is final up to December 2021, updated from January 2022 to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
4,"Starting in the first quarter of 2025, estimates of births are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601). Before the first quarter of 2025, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3231). However, before the first quarter of 2010, the final estimates included in this table may differ from vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory). Birth estimates may be adjusted to account for incomplete birth data."
5,"The number of deaths is final up to December 2021, updated from January 2022 to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
6,"Starting in January 2024, estimates of deaths are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601). Before January 2024, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3233). However, before January 2013, the estimates included in this table may differ from vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory). Deaths estimates may be adjusted to account for incomplete death data."

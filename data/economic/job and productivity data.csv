Date,Note
"","On August 25, 2020, corrections were mainly made to the labour data series for the industries at a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 4-digit level of aggregation from 2018 to 2019. Territorial and provincial estimates for the total economy, business sector and non-business sector, estimates for 2 and 3-digit NAICS industries, and industrial aggregations, as well as data for years prior to 2018 were not affected."
"","On May 27, 2021, corrections were mainly made to the compensation of employees series (including its related measures)  for the industries at a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-digit level of aggregation for the year 2020. The related measures are total compensation for all jobs, total compensation per job, total compensation per hour worked, employee's compensation per hour worked unit labour cost, unit labour cost in US dollars, and labour share. Corrections were also made to growth rates for these variables in the goods-producing businesses and the service-producing businesses. Territorial and provincial estimates for the total economy, business sector and non-business sector, estimates for labour productivity and the 5 other related variables (including hours worked and real value added) at the aggregate and industry levels, as well as data for years prior to 2020 were not affected."
"","On June 13, 2025, the data for all 3-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries within the retail trade sector (NAICS 44 and 45) for years 2022 to 2024 were suppressed due to a premature conversion from NAICS 2017 to NAICS 2022."
"","On July 7, 2025, data on self-employed labour income in the health industry for reference year 2024 and related measures were updated to correct for a modelling discrepancy. There were no impacts on other measures, including jobs, hours and labour productivity."
"","On July 28, 2025, the labour share in the non-business sector (in particular, the non-profit institutions serving households component) was updated for the period from 1997 to 2017. This update aimed to subtract the GDP of owner-occupied dwellings from the calculation of the labour share in these sectors."



Footnotes:
1,"This table replaces tables 36-10-0214 and 36-10-0215, which are now archived. For concepts, methods and sources, see http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/5103-eng.htm. Data by industry included in this table correspond to the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts input-output detailed level of aggregation. The table is built around the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC). This one identifies both Institutional Sectors and Industries based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The alphanumeric codes appearing in square brackets besides each industry title represent the IOIC identification code. The first two characters of the IOIC alphanumeric codes represent the sector. IOIC codes beginning with a BS represent Business Sector industries, codes beginning with an NP represent Non-Profit Institutions Serving Household (NPISH) Sector industries, and codes beginning with a GS represent Government Sector industries. The IOIC is a hierarchical classification. IOIC codes consisting of four alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Summary (S) level of aggregation, IOIC codes consisting of five or six alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Medium (M) and IOIC codes consisting of eight alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Detailed (D) level of aggregation. The classifications of the Input-Output tables can be found at the following link http://www.statcan.gc.ca/nea-cen/hr2012-rh2012/data-donnees/aggregation-agregation/aggregation-agregation-eng.htm."

3,"The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is an industry classification system triggered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, that was developed by the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. It is designed to provide common definitions of the industrial structure of the three countries and a common statistical framework to facilitate the analysis of the three economies. NAICS is based on supply side or production oriented principles, to ensure that industrial data, classified to NAICS, is suitable for the analysis of production related issues such as industrial performance. Since 1997, the industry classification system of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts input-output tables is based on NAICS. In the Macroeconomic Accounts industries, the levels of the different classification systems were chosen so as to provide the most detail possible in order to maximize continuity with the previous classification systems developed by Statistics Canada since 1961.

4,"Estimates of labour statistics associated with the geographic entity "Outside Canada" are not included in this table, but are included in the national estimates. They are published in another table (Table 36-10-0489-01).  As a result, the totals for Canada in this table do not correspond to the sum of its provinces and territories."
5,"The estimate of the total number of jobs covers two main categories: employee jobs and self-employed jobs."
20,"The number of hours worked in all jobs is the annual average for all jobs times the annual average hours worked in all jobs. According to the retained definition, hours worked means the total number of hours that a person spends working, whether paid or not. In general, this includes regular and overtime hours, breaks, travel time, training in the workplace and time lost, in brief, work stoppages where workers remain at their posts. On the other hand, time lost due to strikes, lockouts, annual vacation, public holidays, sick leave, maternity leave or leave for personal needs are not included in total hours worked."
21,"This is the annual average of hours worked per job in all categories of jobs."
22,"The total compensation for all jobs consists of all payments in cash or in kind made by domestic producers to workers for services rendered. It includes wages and salaries and employer's social contributions of employees, plus an imputed labour income for self-employed workers."
23,"For a given industry, value added is equal to its gross production (mainly sales) less its intermediate consumption (energy, raw materials, services) stemming from other industries. The value added corresponds to Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices which corresponds to the GDP at market prices excluding net taxes on products."
24,"Real value added is evaluated in 2017 chained dollars. A double-deflation procedure is used to measure real value added: real intermediate inputs are subtracted from real gross output. For productivity measurement, a real value added Fisher chain index is used for each industry. Chain indexes are calculated for consecutive periods to determine variation of quantities from one period to another. The chain indexes offer the advantage of reducing the variation in the values recorded by the various fixed-base indexes."
25,"Labour productivity is the ratio between real value added and hours worked. Real value added for each industry and each aggregate is constructed from a Fisher chain index."
26,"The ratio between total compensation for all jobs, and the number of hours worked. The term "hourly compensation" is often used to refer to the total compensation per hour worked."
27,"This is the labour cost per unit of output, and it equals labour compensation divided by real value added. It is also equal to the ratio of labour compensation per hour worked and labour productivity. Unit labour cost increases when labour compensation per hour worked increases more rapidly than labour productivity. It is widely used to measure long-term inflation pressures arising from wage growth."
28,"This is the unit labour cost expressed in US dollars. This is obtained by dividing the unit labour cost by the exchange rate between Canada and the United States."
29,"Labour share corresponds to the ratio of total compensation as a percentage to the nominal value added."
6,"Total economic activities that have been realized within the country. This includes both business and non-business sectors."
7,"All economic activities realized within the country for business and non-business activities, but excluding the owner-occupied dwellings industry. There is no data on the number of hours worked by homeowners to maintain their dwellings. By subtracting this activity from the gross domestic product (GDP), we can produce a better estimate of productivity for the total economy, by harmonizing the measurement of hours worked with that of GDP."
8,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11-81, with the exception of owner occupied dwellings industry."
9,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11-81, with the exception of owner occupied dwellings industry, crop production (111), animal production (112)."
10,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11-81, with the exception of owner occupied dwellings industry and private households."
11,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 41, 44-45, 48-49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 72, 81 with the exception of owner occupied dwelling industry and private households."
12,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 21, 22, 31-33 and 562."
13,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 311-316, 322-326."
14,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 321, 327, 331-337, 339."
15,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 211, 2121, 212291, 21311A, 2211, 2212, 32411, 486."
16,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 4173, 5112, 517, 518, 5415, 8112 as well as 334, excluding 3345."
17,"This combines the business establishments of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 52 and 55."
18,"This combines the non-commercial activities of two main components: the government sector (GS) and the non-profit institutions serving households sector (NP)."
19,"This is an industry excluded from the business sector. There is no market transactions for imputed rental values based on residential property information."
